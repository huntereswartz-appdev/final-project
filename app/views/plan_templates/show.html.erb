<h1>Here is your sales #math</h1>

<body>
    We took into account the probabilty of a deal moving on to the next stage in your pipeline.  Then we looked at how much active time you spend working on a deal.  Remember, we're looking at active work, not the total time it takes a deal to go from lead to logo.  We assumed that 1 day of work was an 8 hour day.  
    <p></p>
    Once we take into account the time spent on deals that do not close, we're confident that on average it takes you approximately <%=@deal_time.sum.round(1)%> days of work to complete a deal.
<p></p>
    There are <%=@time%> weeks remaining in your sales period which means you have time to work on <%= @remaining_deals%>  more deals worth on average <%=number_to_currency(@remaining_deal_value, precision:0)%>.
    
<p></p>
    Your current pipepline is worth <%=number_to_currency(@output_pipeline, precision:0)%>.  Based on the number of days left in your period, if you perform as expected, then you will achieve <%=number_to_percentage(@percentage_of_goal*100, precision: 0)%> of your sales goal of <%=number_to_currency(@current_goal.sales_goal, precision: 0)%>.
